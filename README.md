### Hi, I'm Gabriel! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a degree in Software Engineering from UEPG. I've been working professionally as a developer for the past 4 years, focusing primarily on Golang and JavaScript. Currently, I work at EstratÃ©gia Educacional, where I help create scalable solutions for the educational sector.

Recently, I've been diving into the world of learn and build in public, and I plan to soon share my progress and projects with the community.
